# Thesis
This repository contains all experiments performed in this my thesis on "Prediction of protein structure energies using deep learning"

The final models for this thesis(the prediction of protein structure energies) are contained in files validation_second_model.py and validation_third_model.py

The code from the experiments carried out in PyMC3 are based on the following tutorials from Thomas Weicki -
